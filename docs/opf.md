Power flow analysis is the most critical static operation in network calculations. This section explains how to perform various types of power flow analyses (MP-OPF and SC-OPF), highlights known issues and limitations.
=== "Available OPF's"

    * [Multi-Period Optimal Power Flow](mp_opf.md)
    * [Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow](sc_opf.md)

The results of each OPF solution are saved as Excel files named according to the case and the OPF type. For example: ``CS2_MP-OPF_results.xlsx`` and ``CS2_SC-OPF_results.xlsx``.

These result files are stored in a "Results" folder located within the corresponding case scenario directory (e.g., within the ``CS2`` folder in this example).



#### **Results Structure Breakdown**:

The results file contains multiple sheets, starting with the ``main`` sheet, which provides a summary of the entire Excel file. Additional sheets include detailed information such as the power flow through each line and other relevant network parameters.
